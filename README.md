# indecision-app-cloud
Converting the indecision app, which is from a React web developer course I took by Andrew Mead, into a cloud application. 

Original README file text:
This basic React application helps you solve your indecisiveness with computer randomization. This app is built with the help of the "Complete React Developer Course with Redux" taught by Andrew Mead on Udemy.
